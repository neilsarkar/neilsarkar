      <dt>Explicit over implicit, at first.</dt>
      <dd>
        An explicit API has a wider surface area and is more resistant to change. As your objects mature, it usually makes sense to provide implicit calls with sensible defaults.
      </dd>

      <dt>Composability over inheritance.</dt>
      <dd>
        Don't you wish you could just pick and choose your parent's characteristics that you wanted? Instead of just getting everything they had whether you want it or not?
      </dd>

      <dt>Generate three options before choosing one.</dt>
      <dd>
        When you say them out loud, you'll be shocked at how often your best idea was a throwaway option.
      </dd>

      <dt>Ask yourself: what requested change will undo all of this work?</dt>

        Every move you make comes with a tradeoff. Be cognizant of the corners you're painting yourself into.

        Worth it when you finish fast. Doubly worth it when you don't.

        Refactoring is rarely prioritized and distractions abound. Avoiding the temptation of The Heroic Refactor is a good way to make sure your improvements ship.
