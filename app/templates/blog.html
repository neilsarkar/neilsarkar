      <dt>Feed the lizard brain.</dt>
      <dd>
        You created your product with your neocortex, but it is being received by a busy person's animal brain.

        Mobile first.

      <dd>
        If your flows aren't clear enough to work on a small screen, you have problems that media queries won't fix.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        Highlight by subtraction.
      </dt>

      <dt>Prefer individuality.</dt>
      <dd>
        One performant, bug-free, unique feature is worth a thousand me-too fa√ßades.

      <dd>
        Image processing is hardware: it's as old as the first organism with a retina.
        <br />
        Language comprehension is software: it requires more brain cycles.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        Make primary actions easy to do and easy to undo.
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Encouraging risk-free experimentation on your platform will educate people better than any tutorial you can contrive.

        11 people doing one thing very well win super bowls.

        11 quarterbacks are just going to get sacked a whole lot.

      <dt>Duplicate and then abstract.</dt>
      <dd>
        If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it might still be a goose.

      <dt>Explicit over implicit, at first.</dt>
      <dd>
        An explicit API has a wider surface area and is more resistant to change. As your objects mature, it usually makes sense to provide implicit calls with sensible defaults.
      </dd>

      <dt>Composability over inheritance.</dt>
      <dd>
        Don't you wish you could just pick and choose your parent's characteristics that you wanted? Instead of just getting everything they had whether you want it or not?
      </dd>

      <dt>Generate three options before choosing one.</dt>
      <dd>
        When you say them out loud, you'll be shocked at how often your best idea was a throwaway option.
      </dd>

      <dt>Ask yourself: what requested change will undo all of this work?</dt>
      <dd>
        Every move you make comes with a tradeoff. Be cognizant of the corners you're painting yourself into.

      <dt>Aggressively garbage collect your brain's working memory.</dt>
      <dd>
        Leave context in the code, not in your head.
      </dd>

      <dt>Seek out the shortest possible debugging feedback loop.</dt>
      <dd>
        Remember web development pre-firebug? I do. Never again.
      </dd>

      <dt>Timebox the hard/scary stuff.</dt>
      <dd>
        Worth it when you finish fast. Doubly worth it when you don't.
      </dd>

      <dt>Always reproduce bugs locally.</dt>
      <dd>
        The extra time it takes is paid back the next time the thing breaks.

      <dt>Make regular git checkpoints.</dt>

        Make intuitive abstractions, document public interfaces, and save your cleverness for making killer puns.

      <dt>Always stay one step away from green.</dt>
      <dd>
        Refactoring is rarely prioritized and distractions abound. Avoiding the temptation of The Heroic Refactor is a good way to make sure your improvements ship.
      </dd>

      <dt>Build a testing pyramid.</dt>
      <dd>
        Fat stacks of fast unit tests with happy path integration tests sprinkled sparingly on top.
